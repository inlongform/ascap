#### Task

What we would like is for you to reverse engineer and recreate the entire Membership section of OME. This section consists of three Membership type cards that the user can select. It includes validation that ensures the user has selected a card before being able to continue. If the user selects the "Writer & Publisher" or the "Publisher" card a drop-down is displayed asking the user for more information. This dropdown also has validation that does not allow the user to continue unless a selection is made. 

 

Things to consider when recreating the Membership section of OME:

· Javascript Library/Framework (your choice of React, Vue, Vanilla)

· SASS/CSS namespacing

· Card Hover effects

· Card and drop-down validation functionality 

· Card and drop-down validation styles

· Custom drop-down styles

· Cancel and continue button

· Browser compatibility (Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge)

· Component reusability

Extras (not mandatory and time permitting):

· Mobile design

· Unit testing (Jest, Mocha, Chai)
